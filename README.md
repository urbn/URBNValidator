## URBNValidator

Validation is something that everybody should do with user based content. All apps have some kind of input from the user. When you're dealing with input that you don't control (especially forms), then you're opening your app up to a whole world of potential invalid input.

With that said, as developers we hate to do our validation. Who cares if the user typed in 1 instead of 2. We'll just deal with that later. You sir are a jackass. And everybody talks about you behind your back.

Now, you may ask "what about other libraries like QBValidator". You're right. QBValidator is pretty kickass. And we used it for a while. But for some reason the maintainer doesn't want to maintain anymore ðŸ”¥. So instead of forking we decided there were enough additions we wanted to make, that we'd just create our own thing. And you know what, it's badass.

This is the main concept behind the reasoning for URBNValidator.

Now let's dig into what this thing is about



## Features

- Full swift support
- Objc compatibility
- Ability to create your own validations and extend custom types
- Full localization support (global and per instance).
